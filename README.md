This is clone of Airbnb. As we all know, Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accomodations in specific locales.
In my project 'airbnb-spots', I tried to replicate most of functionality of official Airbnb website and support almost all necessary features.
Feature list includes -
 Sign Up and create unique acount for user as owner/renter
 login user
 Owner user can create spots to rent out. Provide all necessary information including images, description, location and price
 Any user can view all available spots to rent out
 Any logged in user can create/update/delete booking of spot. Obviously booking has to be user's.
 Any logged in user can add/update/delete review for any of his/her booking with images and star rating
 Any user can search spots with specific criterias such as price, location etc.
